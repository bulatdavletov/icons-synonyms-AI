# Implementation Plan for Batch Processing Feature

## Phase 0: Split plugin to two tabs - Single selection and Batch selection
Create Tab to work with one file and second tab to work with multiple selections.
I want always to have working plugin.
Currently I have version that works with one file, it should stay.
Batch selection files also should use different files, so not broke existing functionality of single selection.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality and Data Management

### Update Data Structure
- Create a map to store component data with their generated synonyms
- Implement a state management system to track components with pending changes
**Expected Outcome:** Internal data structure capable of tracking multiple components and their states without visible UI changes.

### Selection Handling
- Update the selection handler to support multiple components
- Implement display logic for multiple selected components
**Expected Outcome:** Plugin correctly identifies and stores multiple selected components.

### UI Component "Cards"
- Use current ComponentInfo.tsx to display each selected component. Let's rename it to ComponentCard.tsx
- Separate "cards" using Divider component.
- Update the App component to render multiple component cards
- Add "Regenerate" button for ComponentCard.
**Expected Outcome:** Multiple selected components appear as separate cards in the UI with individual regenerate buttons.

## Phase 2: Batch Generation and Individual Component Actions

### Batch Generation Implementation
- Implement "Generate All" functionality
- Add loading states for individual components during generation
- Create a queue system for processing multiple components
**Expected Outcome:** User can generate synonyms for all selected components with one click. Each component shows its own loading state.

### Visual Feedback
- Add green checkmark indicator for edited components
- Implement visual states for different component statuses
**Expected Outcome:** Users can visually identify which components have been edited or have pending changes.

## Phase 3: Persistence and State Management

### Session Persistence
- Implement persistence of component data when selection changes
- Ensure components with generated synonyms aren't lost on selection change
**Expected Outcome:** Users can change selection without losing work on components they've already processed.

### OpenAI Integration Enhancement
- Update AI service to maintain chat context for improved quality
- Implement batch processing for OpenAI requests
**Expected Outcome:** Higher quality synonym generation and more efficient processing of multiple requests.

### Performance Optimization
- Optimize rendering for multiple components
- Implement virtualization if necessary for large component sets
**Expected Outcome:** Plugin remains responsive even when handling many components simultaneously.

## Testing Milestones

After each phase, we should have a working product with the following capabilities:

### After Phase 1
- Users can select multiple components
- Each component appears as a separate card in the UI
- Users can regenerate synonyms for individual components

### After Phase 2
- Users can generate synonyms for all selected components at once
- Visual feedback shows component status
- Individual components can be saved or reverted independently

### After Phase 3
- Selection changes don't lose component data
- Better quality synonyms
- Plugin performs well even with many components
