Features:
- Batch processing
    - Create separate cards for several selected icons
- Add regenerate button to one icon card
- Check layers inside for modificators


Let's change the logic of how plugin works. Let's do not separate synonyms by groups.
Let's just add all synonyms to a description of component.
I want to see groups in the plugin, but not as the final text in the components description.
I want to click all correct words, and add them to the description of component.

I want to see a preview of the future description of component.

Add something, that checks if the name of icon is the same as name of object that it represents. If it's not the same, - show text - "Base layer required".

Add to prompt that there are 2 the same icons in dark and light theme.
