# Refactoring Summary

## Current State of the Codebase

After reviewing the codebase, I've identified several areas for improvement:

1. **Multiple API Key Management Methods**: The codebase currently has three different ways to handle API keys:
   - Figma client storage (current intended approach)
   - .env file with prebuild script generating config.ts
   - Legacy localStorage in older UI code

2. **Duplicate Files**: There are compiled JS files in the source directory that should only exist in the build directory.

3. **Suboptimal Code Organization**: The code structure is relatively flat and could benefit from better organization.

4. **Unused Dependencies**: The dotenv package is only used for the .env file approach that should be removed.

## Refactoring Benefits

The proposed refactoring will:

1. **Simplify API Key Management**: Standardize on a single approach (Figma client storage) which is more secure and follows best practices.

2. **Improve Code Organization**: Better folder structure with clearer separation of concerns.

3. **Reduce Technical Debt**: Remove duplicate code, unused files, and unnecessary dependencies.

4. **Improve Maintainability**: Cleaner codebase with better type safety and organization.

## Implementation Approach

I've created detailed plans in two files:

1. **refactoring-plan.md**: Overview of what needs to be changed and why.
2. **refactoring-implementation-plan.md**: Step-by-step guide for implementing the changes.

The refactoring can be done incrementally, with the most critical changes being:

1. Remove duplicate files and old API key management approaches
2. Reorganize code into a more logical structure
3. Update imports and ensure all code uses the Figma client storage for API keys

## Next Steps

1. Review the refactoring plan and implementation steps
2. Implement the changes as outlined in the implementation plan
3. Test thoroughly to ensure functionality is maintained
4. Create a pull request with the changes

For optimal security and maintainability, I recommend implementing all the suggested changes before merging the refactoring branch back to main.
