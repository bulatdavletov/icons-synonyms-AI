Output:
Let's change the logic of how plugin works. Let's do not separate synonyms by groups in final description.
Let's just add all synonyms to a description of component.
I want to see groups in the plugin, but not as the final text in the components description.
I want to click all correct words, and add them to the description of component.

- I want to see a preview of the future description of component.

- Add to prompt that there are 2 the same icons in dark and light theme.

- Add something, that checks if the name of icon is the same as name of object that it represents. If it's not the same, - show text - "Base layer required".
