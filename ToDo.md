Batch Processing:
- [ ] Create separate cards for several selected icons
- [ ] Generate is for all selected components, apply is for current component
- [ ] Add regenerate button to one icon card

Description Handling:
- [ ] Must have option should be checked by default: description of an icon
- [x] After Applying - show updated description with ability to edit it
- [x] Current description should be editable from the beginning

- [ ] If I already generate synonyms and changed selection - don't change current component - add a new one
Or add button Clear? It should clear all generated synonyms.

Component Size Variations:
- [ ] Edit description of the same components with another size. So one description should go to all components
    - toolwindow / ant
    - toolwindow / ant@20x20 
    - toolwindow / ant@14x14
    - How it should be in UI: Instead of 1 name there should be 3 names. Search for similar layers should be on the same Figma page only. If any of these components already has a description - it should be shown as a text under the name. But description text area in this case should be one and the same for all of them.

Similar Icons:
- [ ] Find similar named or descripted icons, and copy show their description
How? Should we have list of all icons with descriptions?
- [ ] Check name and description of mods inside

Chores:
- remove code from ui.html and leave a coment that ui.tsx should be used instead
